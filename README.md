<!--Python sorting-algorithms for python -->

# Use <h1>
The code snippets provided should serve as examples of how various sorting algorithms can be implemented in python.
Some search algorithms are implemented suboptimal, e.g. quicksort has an unnecessarily high memory complexity
because it does not work in-place.

## provided algorithm <h2<
-quicksort
-mergesort
-radixsort
-bubblesort
